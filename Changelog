Add from Joshua Phillips
That said, at the current time, the interface in luvcview (v4l2uvc.h and
v4l2uvc.c) does not have a function to set pan and tilt simultaneously.
Since I needed this functionality, I decided to implement it and I have
attached my patch for the two aforementioned files. Maybe they will be
of use to you or anyone else who wishes to use these tools in the
future.
