Avilib  Some utilities for writing and reading AVI files.
 *  These are not intended to serve for a full blown
 *  AVI handling software (this would be much too complex)
 *  The only intention is to write out MJPEG encoded
 *  AVIs with sound and to be able to read them back again.
 *  These utilities should work with other types of codecs too, however.

DISCLAIMER:
-----------
Use this program as you see fit. We are not liable for damages or illegal use
of it whatsoever. You are on your own.
Use of this code is at your own risks. There is absolutely no waranty.
Have fun with it!

BASIC INSTALLATION:
-------------------
These are generic installation instructions.
You need sdl installed with the headers http://www.libsdl.org 
to compile all type:
make
to install in /usr/local/bin as root:
make install 
to clean the last compile work:

the package only need libsdl the jpeg encoder and decoder is now part of the package and allow to work with small footprint
for embedded device. libsdl provide the necessary layer to work on the Linux framebuffer or a Xserver
 
USAGE:
------
luvcview [-h -d -s -g -f -L -l -r -i] [-o outputfile]
 	Grabber Recorder mode
 	    -h	show this usage message.
 	    -d  device ask the driver to use specified video output device (/dev/video1) 
	    -o outputfile  causes the program to output avi  with image data received from the video device to the specified file.
	    -g grab with READ method instead of default MMAP
	    -f video format 	yuv YUYV		fourcc YUY2 
	    			jpg JPEG        	fourcc MJPG

 	    -s	widthxheight ask the driver for input size
 	    -t  display statistics 
	    -r  read control settings from luvcview.cfg
	    -l  list control settings of device
	    -L  list possible formats of device
	    -i fps   set the frame interval in fps
